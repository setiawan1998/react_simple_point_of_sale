This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Simple Point if Sale
### `Getting Started`
This application (order management / place of sale) is an application that you can use to make transactions, manage your products, manage your stock, and you can see everything on the dashboard. although this application is actually a very simple version, the design is also very simple, I don't have much time to beautify it<br />
this application is only frontend, if you want to run it you have to run the backend too

you can find the backend on this https://github.com/setiawan1998/express_simple_point_of_sale
